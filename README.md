## Project Summary
On this project i was tasked with developing a dashboard for the Minnesota Department of Transportation to help monitor traffic patterns and support infrastructure decisions which is a component of my [Google Business Intelligence Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/c4f4857aeaf61150279d9e74d63276fa).
#### The department's goals: included analyzing traffic volume throughout the year, in different weather conditions, and during holidays.

## Key Features
#### Interactive Visualizations: 
Leveraging Tableau and Power BI, the dashboard offers interactive visualizations that provide insights into traffic volume data across various time scales, weather conditions, and holidays.
#### Stakeholder Collaboration: 
The development process involved collaboration with stakeholders via email to understand requirements, gather feedback, and iterate on the dashboard design. This ensured alignment with the department's objectives and user needs.
#### Meticulous Data Processing: 
The dashboard underwent meticulous data processing and customization to ensure accuracy and usability. Custom columns and filters were created to extract relevant metrics, enhancing the dashboard's functionality.
#### Insightful Presentation: 
Key insights and recommendations derived from the dashboard analysis were presented to stakeholders through a PowerPoint presentation. This facilitated informed decision-making by providing actionable insights for infrastructure planning and construction projects.
